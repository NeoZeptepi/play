Preferences and notes for Copilot assistant:

- Keep answers concise by default unless the user asks for detailed steps.
- When making changes: report only deltas and key files edited.
- If deploying: confirm account/project, build, then wrangler deploy with --commit-dirty when local changes are not pushed.
- For legacy site integration: prefer iframe isolation if the legacy code relies on exact CSS/box model.
- Confirm deployment preview URL after each deploy.
